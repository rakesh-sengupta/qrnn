# Quantum Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN)

This repository contains code for implementing a Quantum Recurrent Neural Network (QRNN), showcasing the conversion of a classical recurrent neural network into its quantum counterpart. The QRNN leverages principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to enhance dynamical behavior and improve information processing capabilities.

## Features

- **Quantum Hamiltonian Formulation**: A framework that maps classical neurons and dynamics into their quantum analogs, allowing for the exploration of quantum dynamics in neural computation.
- **Time Evolution Simulation**: Functions to simulate the time evolution of the quantum state under various parameters, including interaction coefficients and quantum noise.
- **Analysis and Visualization**: Tools for computing expectation values of Pauli matrices, population dynamics, and energy expectation, along with visualization of the results to illustrate the system's behavior.

## Installation

To use this code, simply clone the repository and ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy qutip
